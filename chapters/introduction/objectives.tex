\subsection{Objectives}

\subsubsection{General Objective}

The main goal of the present research is to execute and empirical research regarding the use of \textit{gaps} in WGAs. Our main focus is on the improvements of specifity and sensibility of the alignments yielded, as mentioned in our problem statement. 

\medskip

As a general objective, we strive to propose a consensus for the employment of \textit{gaps} in an intergenomic distance, and if so, how shall their use be.

\subsubsection{Specific Objectives}

We propose the three follwoing specific objectives around our general one:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Analyze the main methods for HSP identification and extension, as well as standarizing their outputs to further ease the process of comparing them through different metrics.
  \item Observe the yielded alignments of these methods in a visualizing tool to determine the impact of the use of \textit{gaps} in intergenomic alignment, both in terms of quality and complexity.
  \item Compare the alignments through a metric based on a shortest path heuristic developed by us, and observer in the methods which employ \textit{gaps} yield shorter distances, and therefore better alignments.
\end{itemize}
